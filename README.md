# Restaurant Review App

Sample project to work on responsive design, accessibility and service worker.

## How to Use

Clone the repo, start the web server for Chrome (the easiest way to have a local web server). By default pages are expected to be served on port 8000, if you already have that port in use or would like to change it go to "dbhelper.js" and change the port value,  and serve the resources from this directory.
